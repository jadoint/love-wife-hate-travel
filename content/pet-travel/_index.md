Original post:

For those of us who can't leave our pet at home when we go away for whatever reason, traveling with them is our only option. Most, if not all, airlines no longer allow pets in business class or even in premium economy seating while not every hotel allows pets so traveling comfortably with your furry friend is already more stressful than it already is. For those times where I have to travel with my dog, I'll write about my best experiences here.
