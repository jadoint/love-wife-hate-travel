Original post:

If I'm going to fly a few hours to get somewhere, I'm going to insist on eating well. I'll only write about the restaurants I've eaten in and are worth going to at least once although I've pinned all of the ones I've liked, disliked, and still need to go to on the world map below (all Michelins in New York and the San Francisco areas are currently fully mapped).
