Original post:

We've lived in Boston for a little over three years now and these are the places we consider worth trying at least once ordered by our most preferred place to dine in per price category. The map at the bottom includes far more that we didn't include in this list for one reason or another.
Restaurants

$$$$

Tasting Counter (American): Boston Globe's 2015 Best Restaurant of the Year, Tasting Counter is a dining experience that's been a long time coming to the Boston area. The tasting menu is an eclectic mixture of Asian and American cuisine along with a choice between a wine or sake pairing. The wife and I enjoyed both pairings but the sake was certainly the more interesting of the two with a flight that includes sake derived from a nearly 200 year old mash. Tasting Counter is our favorite restaurant in the Boston area and one of the very few fine dining places we'll consider coming back to in the future. Yelp: 5 Stars (Last visit: June 2016)

Menton (French, Italian): This is our favorite Barbara Lynch establishment. Great food paired with enjoyable service. I split the wine pairing option with my wife for the first time here (I never thought to do that for some reason). I expected some resistance to the idea but our waiter was perfectly fine with that. Yelp: 4.5 Stars (Last visit: May 2016)

O Ya (Japanese): Excellent Japanese restaurant with imaginative dishes by Tim and Nancy Cushman. If you're looking for upscale Japanese dining in Boston, I recommend this place. On the other hand, if you just came back from Japan and are nostalgic for similar dishes in Boston, this isn't it. The closest to authentic sushi place we could find in Boston is Cafe Sushi in Cambridge. Yelp: 4.5 Stars (Last visit: March 2015)

Uni (Japanese): Creative Japanese-inspired dishes. The smoked uni spoon is no joke with a citrus flavor that hits your palate first followed by the mix of uni and egg yolk seasoned with caviar. Uni has been revamped in 2016 after Clio closed and the small downstairs Uni restaurant has taken over both of those floors in the Eliot hotel. Perhaps insist on sitting on the top floor since the downstairs area can have people coming and going through a side door to the hotel. Yelp: 3.5 Stars (Last visit: July 2016)

Craigie On Main (American, French): Good food. Doesn't insist on wine. Unpretentious. A Tony Maws fine-dining establishment. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last visit: June 2015)

Mistral (French): Good food and great wine selection. Good Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Seems less pretentious than L’Espalier. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last visit: December 2015)

L’Espalier (French): You should try this place at least once if you live in Boston and enjoy fine dining but we do prefer many other places instead. Yelp: 4.5 Stars (Last visit: October 2013)

$$$

Cafe ArtScience (Cocktail Bar, American, French): We did an unofficial tasting menu while seated at the bar and we left impressed. This Cambridge bar also makes some of the best whisky and bourbon cocktails anywhere in the area. Cafe ArtScience wasn't even on my original list of places to go but it's now easily at the top of this price tier. This is both a good restaurant or bar to go to after a visit to the Le Laboratoire gallery next door (both founded by Harvard professor David Edwards) and it's one of the few places on this list that I wouldn't hesitate to go back to. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last visit: June 2016)

Cuchi Cuchi (Tapas/Small Plates): Good tapas, great drinks, fun atmosphere. This is where I'd go for a good laid back meal and a decent bourbon cocktail. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last visit: June 2016)

Bistro Du Midi (French): A good upscale Boston restaurant in this price tier. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last visit: November 2015)

Sportello (Italian): Good Italian cuisine by Barbara Lynch. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last visit: June 2015)

Les Zygomates (French): Good oysters. Live jazz music at night. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last visit: September 2014)

Grotto (Italian): Service is lacking but the food is good and it's a great place to take a date. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last visit: December 2015)

The Kirkland Tap & Trotter (American): Good food for meat eaters in Sommerville. A casual Tony Maws establishment. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last Visit: March 2015)

Island Creek Oyster Bar (Seafood): They certainly have a wide selection of oysters but it just wasn't a memorable place (I literally forgot I've been here before). Perhaps I'm just not a big fan of oyster places to begin with ever since I figured out that the ones I can get at the local market just seems to consistently taste better. On the other hand, this place regularly features in Boston top restaurant lists and you should definitely give it a try. Yelp: 4.5 Stars

B & G Oysters (Seafood): Not our favorite Barbara Lynch establishment nor our favorite oyster place but if you find yourself in the South End of Boston and you've already done Myers & Chang and Coppa or you are itching for oysters, you should stop by at least once. Yelp: 4 Stars

$$

Myers & Chang (Asian Fusion): The bao are our favorite. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last visit: February 2015)

Cafe Sushi (Japanese): Possibly the best authentic sushi in Boston at any tier. Try to get the omakase by chef Seiji Imura. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last visit: July 2012)

Orinoco (Venezuelan): Good Venezuelan food. Great for a date in Harvard Square. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last visit: April 2015)

The Tip Tap Room (American): This is our go-to bar in Beacon Hill. Good food with some seasonal cuisine that include game meat dishes. Extensive rotating selection of beers. Yelp: 3.5 Stars (Last visit: February 2016)

Seoul (Korean): It's not going to be the best Korean food you've ever had (NJ / NY / Los Angeles have some incredibly good Korean restaurants), but in Beacon Hill, it's our go-to place for it. Yelp: 3.5 Stars (Last visit: May 2016)

Bonchon - Cambridge (Korean): I don't normally include fast food in my restaurant lists but this place in Harvard Square has some seriously good Nakji Bokkeum (a spicy stir-fried octopus dish) and the only place I know of in Boston that serves Buldak (a heavily spiced chicken dish famous for extreme spiciness). If you enjoy spicy food, order either of these two dishes but insist that they make it authentic and that you can handle the heat. You might have to wait a while to grab a seat on a busy night. Yelp: 3.5 Stars (Last visit: March 2015)

Thelonious Monkfish (Thai, Asian Fusion): I was a little hesitant to include this place. The service is mediocre (maybe the worst on this list) and it seems that their idea of Asian fusion is to simply offer a bunch of dishes from different places. On the other hand, the food they do offer is very good and we find ourselves having food delivered from here quite often (to bypass the service). If you do find yourself in the neighborhood, they do have live jazz performances here quite frequently. Yelp: 3.5 Stars (Last visit: December 2015)
Cafes and Shops

$$

Ogawa Coffee (Japanese cafe): Best place to get a matcha latte. 2010 World Latte Art Champion barista Haruna Maruyama currently works here. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last visit: March 2016)

Tous Les Jours (Korean bakery): Very good baked goods and pastries. Also a great place to grab a mixed grain latte. Yelp: 4.5 Stars (Last visit: May 2016)

Crema Cafe: Has the best grilled sandwiches on Harvard Square. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last visit: December 2015)
