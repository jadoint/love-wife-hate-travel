Original post:

We trekked up to Portland, Maine for a three-day weekend exclusively to try out the great restaurants we've heard about. Not only were we impressed that every restaurant we tried on our list had excellent dishes but we were also pleasantly surprised by the universally friendly service (an aspect of dining we've grown accustomed to not having in Boston). I personally prefer the familiarity of big cities when I travel (they all conveniently share many of the same traits wherever you are in the world) but I enjoyed my time here and want to head back to finish up our restaurant list.
Restaurants

$$$

Miyake (Japanese): This is the sushi place to beat in New England. Their selection and preparation of local fish for their dishes paired well with their seasonings and sauces. My wife especially liked their sashimi dish (pictured above). Yelp: 4.5 Stars (Last visit: May 2016)

Piccolo (Italian): A modern classic Italian restaurant with delicious food run by friendly people. Yelp: 4.5 Stars (Last visit: May 2016)

David's Restaurant (Modern American): We'd come back here based solely on the strength of their Crispy Skinned Duck and the David's Lobster Dinner. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last visit: May 2016)

$$

Central Provisions (Tapas): You can't go wrong with any of the tapas dishes here. Yelp: 4.5 Stars (Last visit: May 2016)

Bao Bao Dumpling House (Chinese-American): A Cara Stadler establishment serving innovative Chinese dishes paired with good service. As the name would imply, their bao dishes along with their dumplings are really good. Yelp: 4 Stars (Last visit: May 2016)

Eventide Oyster Co. (Seafood): Affordable enough to try everything on their menu. In fact, we did try every oyster they had on the menu along with most of the accoutrements they had available (try the horseradish ice). Their other dishes and wide selection of drinks makes this a good brunch / lunch spot. Yelp: 4.5 Stars (Last visit: May 2016)

Grace (American): Yelp: 4 Stars

Lolita Vinoteca + Asador (Mediterranean, Tapas): Yelp: 4.5 Stars

Fore Street (American, Seafood): Yelp: 4 Stars
