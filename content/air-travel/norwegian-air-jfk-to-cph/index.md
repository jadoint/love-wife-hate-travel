Flight: JFK (New York) to CPH (Copenhagen)
Seats: Premium Economy (Best class seating for this flight)

We began our European trip with a flight on Norwegian Air from New York to Copenhagen, Denmark. I was pretty excited to try out the new Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. I hate flying mostly because of how uncomfortable it is for me and by most accounts, the Dreamliner promises to be one of the most comfortable flying experiences available. This is due to several improvements including an air system that's not bleed fed (compressed air taken from the gas turbine engine) like other airplanes reducing air contamination. Cabin air is also able to retain more oxygen and humidity (15% vs an arid 4% based on the old industry standard) because the aircraft frame is able to handle a higher pressure differential between the cabin and the outside so the dry eyes, dry skin, dry mouth effect is reduced along with fewer headaches and dizziness due to the increased oxygen. The engines are also quieter with enhanced noise reduction technologies and the ride should be less bumpy because the plane's fuel efficiency is increased at higher altitudes (other planes don't have enough power to fligh that high). Mood lighting and the ability to electrically dim your viewport allowing for larger windows are just added bonuses. Needless to say, I was curious to see if the Dreamliner was my cure to what is to me, a usually very uncomfortable experience.

Norwegian Air's Dreamliner only has economy and a premium economy offering in a 2-3-2 configuration and my wife and I managed to snag a 2-seater (my wife took the window seat of course). Premium economy seats are 19 inches wide and offer a generous pitch of 46 inches (no lie-flats here) and eight inches more legroom than any other airlines' premium economy offering. On Norwegian Air, premium economy seating offers seat allocation (extra cost for economy) and USB and power ports (not available on economy). Premium fares also include lounge access at airports, fast track security, complimentary drinks, and a three-course dinner.

All of these factors combined led to a fairly pleasant experience for me. The improvements I listed served well to reduce the irritation caused by dry air and I certainly felt more refreshed upon landing compared to if I had done a similar flight with an older aircraft. Surprisingly, I still wasn't able to sleep but it was a relatively short flight, thankfully. Was is it worth making sure that the flight I was on was on the Boeing Dreamliner? Absolutely! I'm now a huge fan. As for Norwegian Air, was it worth going for premium economy over economy on a 7 and a half hour flight? Definitely.
