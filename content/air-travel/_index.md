Original post:

"Love wife, hate travel" actually overstates how I feel about traveling. It's not that I hate traveling to new places, but it's that I loathe flying to get there. Onerous security checks, delayed flights, hours unable to sleep while flying in tightly packed seating in an enclosed space with poor air circulation, topped off with long disembarkation lines really dampen the start and end to a great trip. TSA Pre-Check and Global Entry helps ease the airport security hassle (at least on the U.S. side) but on long flights, it's the airline, plane, and seating that makes or breaks whether or not you're starting your trip refreshed or wasting a day or two to recover. I try hard to avoid the latter.
