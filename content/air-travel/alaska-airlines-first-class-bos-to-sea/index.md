title = 'Alaska Airlines First Class BOS to SEA'
description = "I'm not really a big fan of Alaska Airlines. They're product is serviceable and their service is adequate. However, if you have a pet, there's one big reason to fly Alaska Airlines: they're one of the few (if not only) domestic carriers that has a first class cabin that accepts pets. Ironically, it's probably because airlines with newer planes no longer have the clearance under their first class seating to safely accommodate pets due to more electronics taking space. Alaska Airlines, at the time of this writing, flies older planes on this route (that's my first class seat at maximum recline!) so they don't have that problem."

Original post:

I've been extolling the virtues of JetBlue's Mint class cabin ever since JetBlue unveiled their first class service, but if you're flying into or out of Seattle, you can't go wrong with Alaska Airlines. I'm not personally a big fan of Alaska Air's first class product (evidenced by my lack of photos since there's really not much to take a picture of) since service can be rather run-of-the-mill (a flight attendant spilled a drink on me once and had a momentary look of annoyance because she now had to take care of it) and the seats barely recline (which is a big reason I opt for first class in the first place since planes are terribly uncomfortable most of the time).

Despite all of that, there's one big reason to fly Alaska Airlines if you have a pet: they're one of the very few (if not only) domestic carriers that I know of that has a first class cabin that accepts pets. Ironically, it's probably because airlines with newer planes and upgraded first class cabins can no longer safely accommodate pets under the seat due to more electronics and less clearance space from the seats in front of you having more recline. Whatever the case, I'm glad I could bring my dog along with me.

This was the extent of the recline on my seat.
