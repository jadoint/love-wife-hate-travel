title = 'The Line Hotel - Los Angeles'
description = "The Line Hotel in Los Angeles, California is a relatively new hotel located in the heart of Koreatown. Opened in January of 2014 by the team behind the Ace and NoMad New York hotels, it features a modernist style on the inside as well as the outside. This was our first hotel in the U.S. after we concluded our three month tour of Denmark, Spain, France, and Japan so in contrast to months of small rooms, antique furnishings, or austere Japanese accomodations, the room we stayed in was modern and seemed refreshingly cavernous with floor to ceiling windows greatly amplifying the effect. We enjoyed our time at The Line Hotel and we'd go back if we found ourselves in the neighborhood again. I'd recommend trying to book a room at the 10th floor or above for the best views of the city in this 12-story hotel."

The Line Hotel in Los Angeles, California is a relatively new hotel located in the heart of Koreatown. Opened in January of 2014 by the team behind the Ace and NoMad New York hotels, it features a modernist style on the inside as well as the outside. This was our first hotel in the U.S. after we concluded our three month tour of Denmark, Spain, France, and Japan and I was glad to be back on home soil.

We drove in from the airport and the valet quickly parked our car so we could check into the lobby. There was a decently long line for the front desk but check in was straightforward after that.

In stark contrast to months of small European rooms, antique furnishings, or austere Japanese accomodations, the room we stayed in was spacious, modern, and at 300 sq ft (27 sq meters), seemed refreshingly cavernous and the floor to ceiling and wall to wall window greatly amplified the effect. Not only were the furnishings modern but the room included a media hub as well where you can even connect your laptop to the large screen TV if you wanted to. The bathroom design is reminiscent of a Korean day spa which includes a comfortable white cotton robe and slippers with toiletries customized for the hotel by Baxter of California.

Unlike many of the European hotels we stayed in during our three month trip, The Line Hotel includes a well-equipped fitness center with cardio equipment, weights, and other types of assisted machines. I was surprised not to see heavier dumbells or at least a pull up bar especially since they seemed to have space left for more equipment but considering I've just come back from Europe where fitness centers in hotels were more the exception than the rule, I was just glad they had a gym.

The hotel also has other amenities like an outdoor swimming pool surrounded by citrus trees and lounge chairs as well as a restaurant and bar. My wife and I only managed to have a few drinks at the bar to cap off the night since we preferred to explore the extensive number of other places to eat and drink in the neighborhood.

We enjoyed our time at The Line Hotel and we'd go back if we found ourselves in the neighborhood again. I'd recommend trying to book a room at the 10th floor or above for the best views of the city in this 12-story hotel.
