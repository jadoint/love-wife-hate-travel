title = 'The Westin Palace Madrid - Spain'
description = "This hotel was memorable for me just for their dining room alone. The Westin Palace Madrid first opened in 1912 as the largest hotel in Europe at the time and an understated luxury permeates every aspect of their decor. This place is what old Japanese hotels that opened in the 80's aspire to look and feel like but end up looking gaudy instead. If I'm ever in Madrid again, I'll have to remind myself to eat at this hotel's restaurants all the time since the surrounding local fare can't seem to match the quality of this hotel's food. I'd definitely stay here again just to eat, drink, and sleep my way through my stay in the city."

Original post:

The Westin Palace Madrid was our first hotel stay on our tour of Spain and it was certainly an impressive start. The hotel is conveniently located in central Madrid and was close to the museums my wife wanted to go to and the restaurants I planned to dine in.

The hotel first opened in 1912 as the largest hotel in Europe at the time and was originally called the Hotel Palace. Along with modern conveniences like a telephone in each room, the hotel also featured dance halls, lounges, and ballrooms that still exist in some form today (in fact, there was a wedding reception hosted at the hotel during our stay). The Westin Palace Madrid was declared a part of Spain's Bien de Inter√©s Cultural (Heritage of Cultural Interest) in 1999.

The hotel's rich history is immediately obvious as soon as you walk into their grand lobby and glimpse their ornate dining room with its high glass dome ceiling straight ahead. Check in was straightforward and we quickly made it to our hotel room almost as soon as we arrived.

Our room was large and contained the classically luxurious furnishings one would expect from this type of hotel. The bed was large and comfortable, the upholstery was spotless, and the bathroom was upscale and included premium toiletries.

We didn't have time to dine at most of the hotel's restaurants other than a quick brunch at the La Rotonda which features the Westin Madrid's signature stained glass dome. I regret not having dined at their restaurants now considering I was rather disappointed by not having been able to find any good local places nearby for breakfast or lunch.

The hotel's fitness center was adequate and had enough cardio and weight equipment for the casual gym-goer. It's smaller than it looks in the pictures but I suppose that's offset by the fact that I hardly saw anyone there every time I went. They did have a rack of dumbells, the heaviest of which was at 30 kg or so, across a solitary bench. I found that this is a common theme regarding hotel gyms throughout Spain, if they had one (and many didn't). On the other hand, this hotel gym is unique in that it has a terraced balcony perfect for an after-workout meal or even just as a somewhat secluded place to have drinks with your group.

The terrace right outside of the gym on the top floor.

Overall, it is a great hotel and the enjoyable stay actually served to push me to look deeper into the Starwood Preferred Guest loyalty program (of which I am now an ardent fan). The Westin Palace Madrid is a solid choice and is at the top of a very short list for me whenever I find myself back in Madrid.
