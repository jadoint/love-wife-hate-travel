title = 'Kyoto Hotel Okura'
description = "This is the hotel Steve Jobs raved about in his biography when he visited Japan. It looks nice... for that time period. Plenty of hotels throughout Japan look like their heyday was in the 80s and they never bothered to refresh their look. Although Hotel Okura still looks fairly good, it doesn't hold up against a Park Hyatt."
