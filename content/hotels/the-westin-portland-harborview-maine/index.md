title = 'The Westin Portland Harborview - Maine'
description = "The Westin Portland Harborview is my favorite hotel in Portland, ME as long as I'm willing to walk a little further to most of the interesting places. The service is friendly and the common rooms and amenities were upscale (there was a wedding reception held here during our stay). The pictures below are from both a Traditional King Bed room and a Junior Suite (we were upgraded halfway through our stay)."
