Original post:

Ronda is a very picturesque place with plenty of great-looking architecture and historical sites which made this quaint town a prime destination for our traveling troupe which consisted of my wife, her brother, and his wife. It also featured a few nature trails to hike in so I had something to do.

We stayed at the equally picturesque Parador de Ronda which overlooks the El Tajo gorge. As one of Spain's most famous Parador hotels, it sits adjacent to the city's most famous landmark, the Puente Nuevo bridge.

Having driven from Granada, we were relieved that parking was conveniently located right next to the hotel and was a non-issue. The lobby was adorned with modern decorations befitting a premier hotel of the city with attentive English-speaking staff at the front desk.

Our room was situated next to the public street with a gorgeous view overlooking the Alameda Del Tajo gazebo while our companions had a room facing a shared outdoor pool. Both of our rooms also had access to private porches with its own chairs and tables which was perfect for spending the night drinking outside in the cool air with the wife and friends. The room had space for a four-person dining table and plenty of storage in the full-size closets and cabinets. The bathroom was spacious as well and equipped with premium toiletries.

I'm probably understating this place but it was a great hotel in a very nice city with plenty of things to do. I would stay at this hotel if I found myself in the area again and would highly recommend it. Don't miss the sunset at their patio!
