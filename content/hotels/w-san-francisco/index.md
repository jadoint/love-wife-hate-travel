title = 'W San Francisco'
description = "The W San Francisco is one of my favorite hotels in San Francisco with its excellent service, vibrant design aesthetics, and youthful atmosphere. It's also in a central location located right next to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Yerba Buena Gardens as well as to the 1-Star Michelin Mourad and the 3-Star Michelin Benu. The pictures below are of the 30th floor \"Fabulous Room\". The W is one of the few hotels I'd go out of my way to stay at in San Francisco."
