description = "Out of sheer coincidence, my wife's childhood friend in Seattle was working the front desk here. If we had arrived at any other time, we probably would have missed her too. Blows my mind. After catching up for a bit, she sent us to our room with a nice complimentary bottle of champagne. Other than that, the gym here is actually pretty legit. I think athletes actually stay here fairly often so the equipment has to be better than average."
