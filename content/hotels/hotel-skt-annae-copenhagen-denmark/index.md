title = 'Hotel Skt Annae - Copenhagen, Denmark'
description = "The Skt Annae also has a bit of history: it was established in 1851 by a Mrs. Svendsen and was run illegally as an unlicensed hotel for smugglers and a wide variety of other guests. To be allowed into the hotel, you had to give the pass phrase \"Neptune\". This hotel had the smallest room I've stayed in throughout our entire trip through Europe and Japan, the bed was uncomfortable, the bathroom tiny, and the internet connection was poor, yet oddly enough, it wasn't that bad. There was a restaurant nearby whose name I can't remember but we went back every day lunch and sampled their whole menu, they were that good. I'd stay here again unless there's a Starwood property or a Hyatt that opens up nearby."

Original post:

Formerly the Hotel Neptun, the Hotel Skt Annae is located in the heart of Copenhagen, a very short walk away from Nyhavn Harbour and close to the Royal Theatre as well as to the Str√∏get shopping street. The Skt Annae also has a bit of history: it was established in 1851 by a Mrs. Svendsen and was run illegally as an unlicensed hotel for smugglers and a wide variety of other guests. To be allowed into the hotel, a pass phrase had to be given: "Neptune".

We booked the small double room for whatever reason and cozy doesn't describe it. At 161 sq ft (15 sq meters) it was quite small. If you find yourself booking a room here, I highly recommend that you spend the extra to at least get the standard double. For comparison, the smallest standard guest room at the Copenhagen Marriot Hotel is 387 sq ft (36 sq meters) while the largest suite available at the Skt Annae is 301 sq ft (28 sq meters).

Our bed was somewhat uncomfortable and the bathroom, as can be expected based on the room, was also small with standard toiletries. We were also situated close to the dining room din which was somewhat of a problem based on our jet lagged sleep schedule.

There also wasn't much in the way of amenities. The wifi was free but was poor in quality. Their website mentions a fitness center but other booking sites don't and I was told there wasn't any during my stay.

Despite these issues, I wouldn't necessarily not recommend this hotel. The staff was pleasant, helpful, and spoke English well which sometimes counts for a lot depending on where you've been. We also happened to find our favorite restaurant in Copenhagen about two doors down from the hotel called the Restaurant Sankt Annae. We went back every day for lunch (something we almost never do on a trip), and had a great time sampling every Danish meal they had to offer. If you're coming from somewhere where the particular exchange rate isn't favorable and you're looking for a hotel that's very close to Nyhavn, this hotel is a good deal.
