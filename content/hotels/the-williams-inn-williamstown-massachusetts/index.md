description = "It looks like there's been a huge renovation since the last time we were here. You can see the before pictures first then a clear difference with the after pictures. I'm glad they're still pet friendly! Most hotels don't allow you to leave your dog alone in the room but this one provided us with a crate so we could go to the Clark Art Museum without worrying about where to leave our dog."

Original post:

We were in Williamstown, MA to visit the famous Clark Art Museum. Since our dog was with us, we needed a dog-friendly place to stay. The Williams Inn exceeded our expectations in that regard. Although many hotels don't allow you to leave your dog alone in the room (including this one), the Williams Inn is the only hotel I've encountered to provide us with a crate to keep our dog in while we were away. I wish more hotels provided this amenity instead of forcing us to take him wherever we go especially when most museums almost certainly don't allow pets. Make sure to stop by the bar and restaurant downstairs for a drink by their fireplace!
