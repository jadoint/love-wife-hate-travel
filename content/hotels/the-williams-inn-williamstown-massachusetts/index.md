title = 'The Williams Inn - Williamstown, Massachusetts'
description = "It looks like there's been a huge renovation since the last time we were here. You can see the before pictures first then a clear difference with the after pictures. I'm glad they're still pet friendly! Most hotels don't allow you to leave your dog alone in the room but this one provided us with a crate so we could go to the Clark Art Museum without worrying about where to leave our dog."
