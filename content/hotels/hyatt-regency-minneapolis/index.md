title = 'Hyatt Regency Minneapolis'
description = "The Hyatt Regency Minneapolis is one of the better Hyatt Regency hotels I've visited. It also contains the largest and most complete hotel gym I've ever seen. It has a full length basketball court, punching bags, battle ropes, a racquetball court, and even dumbells that go up to 120 lbs! It functions well as a business hotel (several conventions were going on here during our stay) and has fairly large meeting rooms and halls. The Hyatt Regency may not be as centrally located as Starwood's properties downtown but it's a perfect place to stay in if your convention happens to be at the Walker Art Center."

A basketball court!

A closed basketball court...

There aren't too many gyms equipped with the battle rope much less a hotel gym.

I've seen hotel gyms with punching bags before...

...but not with 120 lb dumbells! Most hotels max out at 60-75 lbs and I max out at 90-100 lbs so having the full range of weights is extremely rare but greatly appreciated.

A racquetball court. Unlike the basketball court, this one's open.
