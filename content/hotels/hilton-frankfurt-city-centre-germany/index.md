Original post:

As our last city on our European tour, the Hilton Frankfurt City Centre in Frankfurt, Germany was an enjoyable stay for us. Despite generally billed as a business hotel, it was close enough to the shopping centers, restaurants, and museums (like the MMK) that it was also in a fairly convenient location for seeing the city. Not just that, since it is a business hotel after all, the amenities were much better than what we had been used to during our trip such as the premium 30 mbps wifi (that you have to pay for if you don't have status at the Hilton although lobby wifi is free), their state-of-the-art fitness center, and their in-hotel restaurant and bar.

The first thing you notice as you walk in is their expansive lobby with its glass walls reaching all the way to the top of the building with its own glass ceilings. Check in was fairly straightforward with a very helpful girl who asked us if it was our first time in Frankfurt and upon hearing so, took the time to suggest places for us to go to on a map.

Our room was also quite spacious, well-furnished, and had a great view overlooking an adjacent park. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom itself was relatively expansive and included a walk-in shower along with the standard premium toiletries.

My wife and I also had a good time at both their bar and restaurant. The girl bartending our drinks was friendly and made for good conversation. The restaurant itself served very good food. We usually don't eat at a hotel's restaurant more than once but we found ourselves coming back for lunch and dinner. Breakfast was served in a separate Executive Lounge and included the standard continental offerings you would expect. They did have one interesting food item that I usually don't see at other hotels and it was their honey with honeycomb offering which was a welcome surprise.

Their fitness center was a real treat even by American standards. It seems to actually be a regular health club that the locals go to so their equipment was excellent which included gymnastics rings (well not really but similar), row machines, pull up bars, rows of cardio equipment, and dumbells that go past 90 lbs (in comparison, dumbells in Spain and France rarely seem to go past 70 lbs). My wife also noted how remarkably clean their swimming pool was even in comparison to some Equinox swimming pools used by competitive swimmers in New York City.

I've read that the checkout experience had been an issue with a few reviewers but ours was fairly speedy.

All in all, we got more than what we expected for a hotel that sold itself as a business-ready hotel and had a great stay.
