title = 'Hyatt at Olive 8 - Seattle'
description = "I wasn't sure what to expect with the Olive 8. It wasn't a Grand Hyatt, not a Park Hyatt, and not a Regency. I was glad I didn't pass it up as it was one of my more relaxing Hyatt stays considering my comfortable room up in the Quiet Floor, the bright well-equipped gym with floor to ceiling windows, full-length swimming pool, and the friendly staff at the openly-designed lobby (that I forgot to take a picture of). Better yet, it's only a category 4 Hyatt which not only means less points per stay if redeeming points, but the Olive 8 also qualifies for a free night anniversary stay if you have the Hyatt credit card. The Hyatt at Olive 8 ranks up there as one of my favorite Hyatts."
