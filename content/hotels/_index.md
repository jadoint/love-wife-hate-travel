Original post:

Hotels aren't actually as important to me as comfortable air travel. After all, whereas spending hours on a plane unable to sleep and wishing it was all over only to realize there's five more hours to go is pretty terrible, I can at least actually leave the hotel whenever I want and simply treat it as a bed to go to when the day is over. However, a comfortable, spacious hotel with great amenities is the difference between waking up refreshed and ready to go and waking up and needing to escape.
