title = 'Grand Hotel De Lopera - Toulouse, France'
description = "This hotel was pretty memorable for me. We stayed in the second smallest hotel room I've been to in most of my travels yet (the first was in Copenhagen) it was comfortable and even opulently furnished. The restaurant food was great (it is France after all) but I'd opt to eat inside than outside since there is going to always be that one person smoking while they eat (it is France after all). The staff was also pretty friendly which is notable especially if you've only ever been to Paris. All in all, I'd stay here again if I find myself back in Toulouse."

Original post:

The Grand Hôtel de l'Opéra in Toulouse was the last hotel we stayed in throughout our trip through southern France. Housed in a former 17th-century convent, the Grand Hôtel de l'Opéra is located in the heart of Toulouse situated right across from Place du Capitole. It's convenient location near the city center's shops, restaurants, and museums makes it an obvious choice for a place to stay.

The first thing you notice as you walk into the lobby is that the hotel is ornately decorated with furnishings that remind you of it's 17-century roots. The staff at the front desk was friendly and check in was a breeze.

We only managed to get the smallest room they had available (237 sq ft / 22 sq m) due to a convention happening that week. Although it was one of the smallest rooms I've stayed in throughout the entirety of our trip (second only to our room in Copenhagen), the soft bathrobes, luxurious bathroom, the opulent red furnishings, and the large, comfortable bed made up for the room's size.

The hotel also features the Terre de Jade spa which features a sauna, steam room, and Turkish bath although there is no fitness center. Either way, I didn't manage to take advantage of this offering.

I personally think this is one of the best hotels in Toulouse for its convenient location, amenities, and its 17-century charm although you may want to book a room that's at least one size up from their smallest offering. However, if you're an IGH rewards member or a Chase card holder with Ultimate Rewards points to burn, you may also want to try the Crowne Plaza Toulouse right next door with its larger rooms, modern amenities, and on-site fitness center.
