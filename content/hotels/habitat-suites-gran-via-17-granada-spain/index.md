Original post:

We arrived in Granada to beautiful weather after a long drive from Madrid. The wife wanted to get her fill of the usual museums, churches, and the Alhambra, considered by some to be one of the 10 wonders of the world. As it turned out, the city appealed to me as well since the tapas are free as long as you keep paying for your drinks.

One of the hotels that appealed to us due to its convenient central location is the Habitat Suites Gran VÃ­a 17. Situated near the Granada Cathedral, the Plaza Isabel La Catolica, and the Madraza of Granada, everything my wife wanted to see was within walking distance. We had a very good initial impression when we arrived with a friendly lady manning the front desk and a bottle of complimentary wine waiting for us in our room. Our suite was clean and included a kitchen, living room, two bedrooms, and unlike many European hotels, a spacious bathroom. Despite our room overlooking the main street below, it was relatively quiet at night. My wife's brother and his wife stayed in the room facing the courtyard and had no noise issues either.

Lobby - You may have to call for someone in the back room there to come out since the front desk may not always be manned.

Living room - This was a great first impression for us. There was actually a complimentary bottle of wine on the coffee table when we first walked in.

The bathroom was spacious and included a walk-in shower.

Other than the free wifi (which was rather poor at the time of our stay), the hotel offers few other frills. If you're looking for a comfortable, spacious place to stay while you spend most of your day walking about the central part of town, this is a good one. If you're looking for someplace with a few more amenities like a fitness center, premium internet, and an on-site restaurant, Marriot's category 7 AC Palacio De Santa Paula, Autograph Collection may be a good closeby alternative especially if you're a part of their loyalty program.
