description = "It was a bit of a trip to get here but it's probably one of the few times that I'm glad I made the trek. The hotel has a rustic vibe and has great views, friendly reception, and good food. Not only that but there's a decent pub here and they even grow their own vegetables that they use for their restaurant. I found the entire experience to be fairly relaxing which is actually pretty rare when I travel. If all of my travels were like this, the name of this site would have to change."

Original post:

For someone who prefers not to follow his wife's hectic travel itineraries, I was relieved to find the relaxing Hotel Torre de Villademoros which was a great find on our road trip along the northern coast of Spain. Located in Valdes somewhere in the middle of our trip from Luarca to Salinas, the hotel is situated a biking distance away from the Bay of Biscay (fortunately, bikes can be rented at the hotel as well).

It was a bit of a trip to get here past hard to find narrow winding roads but the parking space was large and located at the courtyard entrance. As you look around the courtyard greenery and glimpse the ocean in the horizon, you quickly get the sense that maybe not staying at a major hotel chain wasn't such a bad idea after all.

Reception was friendly and the interior (lobby and rooms) is decorated with modern-style furnishings but with a rustic vibe. The rooms themselves were comfortable and spacious with picturesque views overlooking the courtyard and the ocean in the distance. There was plenty of closet and floor space for our clothes and luggage and the bathroom was clean and modern and stocked with premium toiletries. There is actually a separate tower (hence "torre" in the name) that you can reserve for rooms as well but it was unfortunately booked at the time.

The tower.

Hotel amenities. It feels very homey and modern at the same time.

Room decorations and views.

The hotel restaurant was a gem and served amazing dishes from the area. Our party dined outside and dinner for us included Asturian meat, Cantabrian seafood cuisine, and various egg, sausage, and vegetable dishes in the area. The hotel also features a pub with a wide range of spirits, beers, and wines and you're welcome to have a drink by the fireplace or in the garden.

The hotel is adjacent to the farm where they grow the vegetables they serve at their restaurant. You can also take a 15 minute walk down to their privately owned beach ocean although you may want to wear walking shoes because of the rocky path. Though the beach itself is also rocky, it is secluded and perfect for having the beach to yourself.

This was truly a relaxing stop for me in what was a hectic travel schedule. My wife enjoyed her stay so much so that she considered having our wedding ceremony held in the area until the hotel owner himself tried to convince her out of it since everything would be quite out of the way for our guests and the hotel itself wouldn't be able to accommodate them all. If you happen to find yourself on a road trip through the northern coast of Spain, make sure you stop by this slightly out of the way hotel. You're in for a memorable time.
