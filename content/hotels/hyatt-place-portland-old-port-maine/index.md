title = 'Hyatt Place Portland Old Port - Maine'
description = "The Hyatt Place at Old Port in Portland, ME is a pretty good place to stay in a central location to most of the shops and restaurants in the city. The only caveat to be aware of is that you're pretty close to the party in the street below even on the high floors so it can get loud until as late as 2 AM. The hotel helpfully provides ear buds to muffle the sound though I was better off with my noise canceling ear phones. I don't think my wife slept well though. Despite the noise issue, the room was great and the bed and furniture were comfortable. If you can sleep through a party or are in the party yourself, then the Hyatt Place at Old Port is the place for you."
