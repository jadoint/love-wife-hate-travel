title = 'Park Hyatt New York'
description = "The flagship Park Hyatt! The best part about the room is that bathtub with the view, heated floors, and the waterfall shower. Otherwise, it looked and felt a little sterile. The Park Hyatt Tokyo has much more character and is still the best Park Hyatt for me so far."
