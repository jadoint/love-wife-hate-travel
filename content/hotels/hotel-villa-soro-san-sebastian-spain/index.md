Original post:

The Hotel Villa Soro is a late 19th century luxury villa located in the center of San Sebastián. As one of the more picturesque hotels in San Sebastián with its manicured lawns and regal furnishings, it has recently been renovated and declared a Historical Heritage of San Sebastián. Although it's just a 10 minute walk from Kursaal, Old Town, and Zurriola beach, you're also able to rent bikes from the hotel or you may want to arrange a ride into town depending on the weather.

The rooms were comfortable with modern furnishings while the bathrooms were luxurious. The Deluxe Villa is certainly a step up from their standard double room as they are the original rooms from the family who used to live in the estate before it became a hotel.

Their food was also delicious as we ate in their elegant dining room although considering you're in San Sebastián, you probably shouldn't eat here too often and instead try as many different restaurants in the area as possible like Mugaritz and Akelarre. You also have the option of having breakfast by the garden which proved to be an incredibly relaxing way to start the morning.

The hotel has a small fitness facility with a handful of cardio equipment and some weights but if you're looking for a gym that's at the same level as in international hotels, you'll be disappointed. On the other hand, just having one at a locally-run Spanish hotel is already a miracle in itself.

There are certainly other accommodations that may be in more convenient places but if you're looking for a comfortable stay or a romantic getaway with your wife in San Sebastián, this is where you start.
