title = 'Sheraton Seattle Hotel'
description = "Out of all of Starwood's brands, the Sheraton is the one that sticks out to me as the least looked-after. The Sheraton tends to be comparable to Hyatt's Regency brand yet I've usually had more comfortable rooms and better treatment at Regency than at the Sheraton. The Sheraton Seattle is no different with its bland rooms, perpetually long lines and unenthusiastic employees in comparison to Starwood's other properties. Why stay here when Hyatt's Olive 8 is nearby?"

Original post:

Out of all of Starwood's brands, the Sheraton is the one that sticks out to me as the least looked-after. I suppose the Sheraton is Starwood's business hotel brand but so far, I've usually had better treatment with more comfortable rooms at Hyatt's Regency hotels than at the Sheraton. The Sheraton Seattle is no different what with its seemingly perpetually long lines, unenthusiastic service in comparison to Starwood's other properties, and rooms in need of an update. Perhaps I'm being critical especially when I was just at Hyatt's Olive 8 before my stay here, but I'll hold off on any more Sheraton stays unless there's a compelling 3x bonus points offer or something.

The line got much longer than this later on in the day.

The Union Street Tower is to your right as soon as you enter the hotel's lobby.

The Pike Street Tower is to your left when you first enter the hotel. The Pike Street Tower is where you can find Sheraton's gym on the 35th floor.

At least the gym isn't so bad with decent equipment, a pool, and good views of the city although it's a bit small for a hotel of this size.
