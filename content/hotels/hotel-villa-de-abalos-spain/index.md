title = 'Hotel Villa De - Abalos, Spain'
description = "The Hotel Villa de Ábalos is located in the small quaint village of Ábalos and served as our home base for touring the La Rioja region and its wineries. It was certainly a departure from our usual hotels in the city with all of their modern amenities and that's not a bad thing. With cozy rooms, wooden window shutters, and an interior that harks back to 17th century stone, wood and wrought iron, the family run hotel and its welcoming owners made our stay feel like we were visiting a home that's been a part of the town since its beginnings. The lack of air conditioning may or may not be a deal breaker for you depending on the season you visit but it's something you may want to keep in mind if you're in the middle of a heat wave. Since this hotel has the only real open bar in the area, the locals often gather here as well for food and drinks and is a central part of the community. Breakfast and dinner consisted of delicious dishes from the region as well as the hotel owner's own wines although unlike the hotel staff, dining room service can be brusque. Outdoor garden seating is also available when the weather is accommodating."

Since it's also the only real open bar in the area, the locals often gather there as well for food and drinks and is a central part of the community. Breakfast and dinner consisted of delicious dishes from the region as well as the hotel owner's own wines although unlike the hotel staff, dining room service can be brusque. Outdoor garden seating is also available when the weather is accommodating.

Although driving is probably the most convenient way to visit this area, I believe you can find tours that have this particular hotel as a stop. If you do choose to drive in, the hotel has a gated parking lot in the back. All in all, it was a great place to stay with a convenient location for touring the La Rioja region.
