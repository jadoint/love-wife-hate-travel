Original post:

A major part of what I hate about traveling is the flying experience. There are ways to make it a little more bearable like having Global Entry but having a comfortable seat to settle into ranks right up there for me. Since I almost never manage to sleep even on 14 hour flights (it's only ever happened once), getting the best seat for me means not having to waste the first day or two of my trip recovering from the ride. Your choice of credit cards can go a long way not only for upgrading your flying experience by helping you get seats and perks you normally wouldn't want to pay for, but can also get you great hotel rooms as well. These posts aren't meant for experienced rewards hackers and churners. These are about the cards that work for me and why I keep them. Start with the Credit Card Rewards Programs post and work your way from there!
